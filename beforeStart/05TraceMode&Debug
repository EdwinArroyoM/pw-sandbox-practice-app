# Tutorial: Trace and Debug with Playwright

## Enabling Trace Mode

1. **Run Tests with Trace**:
   - Use the `--trace on` flag when running your tests to enable trace mode:
     ```sh
     npx playwright test --trace on
     ```

## Viewing Traces

1. **Open Trace Viewer**:
   - After running your tests, open a terminal in VS Code.
   - Run the following command to open the Playwright Trace Viewer:
     ```sh
     npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
     ```
   - Replace `trace.zip` with the path to your trace file.

## Debugging Tests

1. **Run Tests in Debug Mode**:
   - Use the `--debug` flag when running your tests to enable debug mode:
     ```sh
     npx playwright test --debug
     ```

2. **Debugging Session**:
   - The test will start in debug mode.
   - Use the debug controls in VS Code to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions.

That's it! You have successfully enabled trace mode and debugged your Playwright tests.
